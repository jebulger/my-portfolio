            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! Originally from upstate New York,
                I moved into the Wake Forest area around eight 
                years ago. Being close to Raleigh, I spend a good
                amount of time enjoying the downtown area. Especially, to
                my surprise, its ever-growing tattoo scene. I love it so
                much, I acutally ended up working at a tattoo shop downtown
                for a long while. 
                <!-- These are line breaks for making the text
                a bit easier on the eyes. -->
                <br>
                <br>
                As much as I enjoy tattoos, I am equally 
                passionate about cars and learned a bunch working
                at a mechanic shop. Currently in the process
                of modifying my Focus St, and it has been fun. However,
                my favorite hobby is without a doubt music. Concerts,
                live music, streaming, karaoke, I have a fondness for
                everything about it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, I am trying to learn full-stack website 
                development through a coding bootcamp with UNC
                Chapel Hill. So far it has been great. There is a seemingly
                endless amount to learn with coding. Which means there is
                always room to improve, which is the coolest thing about it. 
                With this class, my goal is to develop a good coding foundation, 
                then continue to hone it throughout my life.
